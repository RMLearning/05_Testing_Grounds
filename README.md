Udemy Unreal Engine Developer Course Section 5: Testing Grounds FPS

## GDD
Testing Grounds initially will be based off the lectures given within the context of the courses found at [Udemy Unreal Engine Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/ "Udemy Unreal Engine Developer"). This is a living document, and will be edited as changes are made to the concept and scope.

### Concept
* You're a contestant in an entertainment game
* Survive as many testing grounds as possible
* Continual iteration of testing grounds rooms
* You can use force or stealth to pass the grounds.

### Rules
* You can pass a testing ground undetected
* If detected you must clear the area
* You're scored on how many areas you pass

### Requirements
* Testing ground scenery
* Props and textures
* A rigged humanoid character we can modify
* Gun and projectile meshes
* Various SFX, examples from [Gamemaster Audio](https://www.gamemasteraudio.com/ "Gamemaster Audio - Professional Sound Effects, Sounds for Games")

### Potential Technical Challenges

* Controlling skeletal animations
* AI behaviour and awareness
